# IqUp-Web — Current State

> Live snapshot of the repo. **Code updates this at the end of every phase.** If this and the live code ever disagree, the live code wins.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-16 — after Phase 2.02 (CRM contact routing + new-lead notification). The instant a lead saves, the same isolated `after()` work now fans out **three** side-effects: the 2.01 results email, **a Brevo Contacts upsert** (the parent becomes a CRM contact by email, on an operational "all leads" list always + a marketing/nurture list **only on `marketing_opt_in`**), and **an internal new-lead notification** to IqUp's team — each fully isolated (any one failing/slow/unconfigured can never break the save, the redirect, or the others), and each a logged no-op until its Brevo env lands. Nothing stored changed (no schema/column, no Brevo id persisted — Supabase stays the system of record). Live delivery is **deferred-pending-config** (build/typecheck/lint/test all verified; 190 tests). _(Previously: after Phase 2.01 — the funnel reached the parent's inbox with a warm bilingual results email + attached certificate via Brevo, deferred-pending-key. After Phase 1.11 — Part 1 complete: the whole funnel land → test → gate → lead saved → strengths profile + certificate, with a WCAG 2.2 AA pass, a median-of-5 Lighthouse sweep, and a cross-device matrix.)_

## Routes / pages built

- `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx` — the **real landing page** (phase 1.06): Server Component composing
  header, hero (hook + honest explainer + age picker + Start CTA), how-it-works (3 steps), trust
  cues, reassurance strip, footer. Per-locale `generateMetadata` (title/description/canonical/
  hreflang/OG/Twitter). The Start CTA links to `/test?age=N` (the test route is built in 1.07).
- `src/app/[locale]/opengraph-image.tsx` — dynamic per-locale OG image (1200×630, `next/og`,
  Cyrillic-safe Rubik). Generated for `/mk/opengraph-image` and `/en/opengraph-image`.
- `src/app/[locale]/test/page.tsx` — the **test engine** (phase 1.07): a Server Component shell that
  reads `?age=N`, resolves the band via `getBandForAge`, mounts the client runner, and (on a missing/
  invalid age) renders an inline age-picker fallback that reuses the landing's `AgeStart`. Per-locale
  `generateMetadata` (title/description/canonical/hreflang/OG). **Dynamic route** (reads searchParams).
  Now passes the exact `age` and the resolved gate copy to the runner (phase 1.08).
- `src/app/[locale]/result/page.tsx` — the **real results page** (phase 1.10): a **Static (SSG)** Server
  Component shell that resolves the `Result` chrome server-side + mounts the `ResultView` client island,
  which reads `iqup.testResult.v1` + `iqup.leadContext.v1` from sessionStorage and renders the warm
  strengths profile + the shareable certificate (no total/IQ/score/bar/rank anywhere). Still guards
  direct access (redirects home if either key is missing). Per-locale `generateMetadata` + header/footer.
- `src/app/[locale]/result/opengraph-image.tsx` — **generic, name-free** per-locale `/result` OG image
  (1200×630, `next/og`, Cyrillic Rubik) — a shared result link previews on-brand without any child PII.
- Locale routing works: `/` serves MK, `/en` serves EN, and `/mk` 307-redirects to the canonical `/` (next-intl `as-needed`).
- `/_not-found` is handled by Next.js's default.

## Components built

- `src/components/landing/` — `SiteHeader`, `Hero`, `AgeStart` (client island: age radiogroup +
  gated Start link), `HowItWorks`, `TrustCues`, `Reassurance`, `SiteFooter`, `Wordmark` (logo
  stand-in), `HeroArt` (abstract decorative placeholder for licensed Bibi art), `Reveal` +
  `MotionProvider` (LazyMotion entrance animation).
- `src/components/LanguageToggle.tsx` — accessible MK/EN **pill** switcher; preserves the current
  path (sets `NEXT_LOCALE` on switch); takes its label as a prop.
- `src/components/ui/` — `button.tsx`, `card.tsx`, `radio-group.tsx`, `label.tsx`, and (1.08)
  `input.tsx` + `checkbox.tsx` (handover §B.5 primitives on the unified `radix-ui` package).
- `src/components/gate/` — `EmailGate` (the 1.08 email-gate form island) + `copy.ts` (`GateCopy`).
- `src/components/result/` — the **real results profile + certificate** (phase 1.10): `ResultView`
  (client island; replaced `ResultPlaceholder`), `ResultHero`, `StrengthsConstellation`, `ParentNote`,
  `CertificateCard` + `Certificate` (+ `certificate-model`, `StrengthGlyph`, `bibi`), `TrialInvite`,
  `CuriousMindEnding`, `copy` (chrome type). `src/lib/a11y/contrast.ts` backs the certificate AA test.
- `src/lib/bands.ts` — canonical band definitions (`3-5`/`6-9`/`10-13`), `getBandForAge`,
  `isValidAge`, `BANDS`/`AGES` (+ `bands.test.ts`, Vitest).
- `src/components/test/` — the runner island and its parts: `TestRunner` (phases start/running/**gate**
  + answers + hand-off + dev wiring; dynamic-imports `EmailGate`), `QuestionView` (one question +
  reveal mechanic), `OptionTile`, `ProgressHeader`, `StartScreen`, `DevBar`, `StrengthChip`, `copy.ts`,
  and `visuals/` (`Glyph`, `StemVisual`, `lexicon`) — original inline-SVG + Lucide puzzle graphics.
  (The temporary 1.07 `CompletionView` was removed in 1.08 — the email gate is now the post-test step.)

## Test engine (phase 1.07)

- **Content as data** (`src/content/test/`): all **36 questions** transcribed verbatim from the 1.04
  spec (`docs/content/Part-1-Phase-04-Content-Spec.md`) into `band-3-5.ts` (10), `band-6-9.ts` (12),
  `band-10-13.ts` (14), each tagged to exactly one strength; MK is verbatim, EN mirrors it. The
  schema (`types.ts`) carries a typed `GlyphSpec`/`StemSpec` visual model so stems + image options are
  data. `index.ts` exposes `getQuestionsForBand` / `ALL_QUESTIONS`.
- **Strengths taxonomy** (`src/content/strengths.ts`): the six strengths (spec §1) — code, 1.03
  colour-token binding (`words_obs`→`verbal`), bilingual display names — the single source shared by
  scoring now and the 1.10 results screen.
- **Scoring** (`src/lib/scoring/`): deterministic `score(answers, band, locale)` (spec §3) — ratio per
  strength, fixed tie-break `pattern, logic, spatial, numeracy, memory, words_obs`, tiers
  celebrated/also/growing. **No total, no IQ number** anywhere.
- **`TestResult` hand-off contract** (what 1.08 + 1.10 consume):
  `{ version: 1, band, locale, strengths: { code, total, hits, ratio, rank, tier }[6] (ranked),
  top1, top2, top3, growing[], completedAt }`. On the final answer the runner computes it, stamps
  `completedAt`, and persists it to **`sessionStorage['iqup.testResult.v1']`** (`TEST_RESULT_STORAGE_KEY`).
  No child data is ever placed in the URL (only `age`).
- **1.08 plugged in** at the `// HANDOFF (1.08)` seam: the runner now ends in a `gate` phase rendering
  `EmailGate` (which reads the in-memory + persisted `TestResult`) and submits the summary-only lead.
  **1.10 plugs in** by reading the same `TestResult` (+ the `iqup.leadContext.v1` lead-context written
  by the gate) and rendering the strengths profile + certificate from the §6 templates at the
  `// PLUGS INTO 1.10` seam in `src/components/result/ResultPlaceholder.tsx`.
- **Reveal mechanic** (spec §7) for the 5 memory items: "Ready?" → stimulus shown for `revealMs` →
  auto-hides → question; reduced-motion gets a manual Show / "I'm ready" path (no timer).
- **i18n:** a `Test` namespace in `mk.json` + `en.json` (exact key parity) holds the runner chrome;
  question/option content stays in `src/content/test/`.
- **Dev preview:** `/test?age=N&dev=1` (non-production only) shows a band-jump + auto-finish bar and a
  strengths summary on completion; forced off / stripped in production.

## Email gate + lead capture (phase 1.08)

- **The gate** (`src/components/gate/EmailGate.tsx`): a parent-mood form at the runner's `gate` phase —
  parent email, child first name (Cyrillic + Latin), **required** consent, **optional/unchecked**
  marketing, and an off-screen honeypot. `age`/`band`/`locale`/strengths-summary are carried through
  (in-memory `TestResult` + the page's `?age=N`), never re-asked, never in the URL. WCAG 2.2 AA:
  associated labels, `aria-invalid`/`aria-describedby`, focus to the first invalid field, `role="alert"`
  error banner, keyboard checkboxes, ≥44px label-row targets, AA contrast.
- **Submit** (`src/lib/leads/submit-lead.ts`, `'use server'`): honeypot check first (filled → success-
  shaped, no insert) → `buildLeadInput` → existing service-role `insertLead()`; everything re-validated
  by `leadSchema`. Pure mapping in `src/lib/leads/lead-mapping.ts` (`LEAD_BAND_BY_KEY` 3-5/6-9/10-13 →
  band-a/b/c; `toTopStrengths` = `{top1,top2,top3,scores}`, scores = per-strength ratio, number-only;
  `CONSENT_VERSION = 'v1-draft-2026-06'`).
- **Hand-off** (`src/lib/leads/lead-context.ts`): on success the gate persists `iqup.leadContext.v1`
  (`{childFirstName, age, submittedAt}` — no email/strengths) and navigates to `/result`.
- **Guardrails (verified):** no answers, no IQ/total anywhere (lead, gate, `/result`); summary-only;
  server-side write only (anon denied); consent mandatory + separate from marketing; no PII in URL.
- **i18n:** `Gate` + `Result` namespaces in `mk.json`/`en.json` (exact parity; provisional MK flagged).
  The Privacy Policy reference is plain text with a `// TODO(privacy-page)` seam (Part 2).
- **Dev:** `?dev=1` auto-finish now lands on the gate (stripped in production).

## Results profile + shareable certificate (phase 1.10)

- **`/result` is now the real payoff screen** (`ResultView` island): a "two moods, one scroll" layout
  — a **playful zone** (reveal hero with the child's first name, a positive-only **strengths
  constellation** of three non-evaluative tiers, and the certificate) flowing into a **calm zone**
  (parent §6 prose + the band handoff). It reads the SAME hand-off (`iqup.testResult.v1` +
  `iqup.leadContext.v1`), keeps the direct-access guard, and stays an **SSG shell + client island**.
- **Strengths constellation** (`StrengthsConstellation`): celebrated = top1/top2 (big badges), also =
  top3 (chip), growing = #4–#6 (encouraging chips). The ranked `TestResult` only *orders* the tiers —
  **no score, IQ, %, bar, gauge, or medal anywhere**. Accents come from `--strength-*` tokens via
  `src/content/strengths.ts`.
- **Result copy** (`src/content/results/`): the spec §6 templates as typed data — per strength ×
  tier × locale blurbs + the §6B/§6C wrapper. `getResultCopy(result, name, locale)` assembles the
  celebrated/also/growing copy. **No digits/%/score/rank words** in any user-facing string (tested).
- **The certificate** (`Certificate.tsx`, **1080×1350 portrait 4:5**): child name + celebrated
  strengths + IqUp branding + a licensing-safe **Bibi placeholder** (drop-in via `bibi.ts`
  `BIBI_CERT_ART`). **Deterministic per-child tint** (frame top1→top2 tints, flourish = top1) on a
  **constant cream** background, so AA holds for every tint (verified in `certificate-model.test.ts`).
  **Download** = client-side `html-to-image` PNG (≈1080×1350, fonts embedded after `document.fonts.ready`);
  **Share** = Web Share API file share + a copy-the-landing-URL fallback. The child's name never leaves
  the browser.
- **Trial invite** (`TrialInvite`, bands **3–5 / 6–9**): the §6 CTA + a **city picker** over the 10
  centres (`src/content/centers.ts`, single source) revealing the chosen centre + working contact
  (`tel:`/`mailto:` + the IqUp contact form) behind a `// TODO(booking 2.05)` seam. Band **10–13** ends
  with `CuriousMindEnding` (no trial).
- **OG image:** `src/app/[locale]/result/opengraph-image.tsx` — generic, **name-free**, Cyrillic-safe.
- **i18n:** the `Result` namespace was rewritten for the real chrome (hero, constellation, certificate
  face, parents, trial, ending) in both locales (exact parity). **All new MK provisional.**

## Results email (phase 2.01)

- **The funnel now reaches the inbox.** After `insertLead()` succeeds, `submitLead`
  schedules `after(() => sendResultsEmail(...))` (`after` from `next/server`), so the parent's
  redirect to `/result` is never delayed and the work still completes on serverless. The honeypot
  path returns before this — **bots never send**.
- **Fully isolated.** `sendResultsEmail` (`src/lib/email/send-results-email.ts`, `server-only`) is
  internally try/caught and **never throws**; a slow/failing/unconfigured Brevo can't affect the
  lead save or the redirect. With `BREVO_API_KEY` unset it logs `skipped-no-key` and returns (the
  app runs locally before Cowork's account exists).
- **Same content as the screen, no new data.** It rebuilds the on-screen ranking from the lead's
  stored ratio summary via `reconstructResult` (`src/lib/scoring/reconstruct.ts`, reusing `score()`'s
  comparator/tiers — proven byte-identical), assembles the body from `getResultCopy` (the single
  source), and renders the **certificate PNG** (`src/lib/email/certificate-image.tsx`, Satori/`next/og`,
  1080×1350, Rubik + Nunito Sans Cyrillic, per-child tint, Bibi placeholder) **attached** to the email.
  The child's name is rendered in memory and attached — **never stored, never in a URL**.
- **The email** (`src/emails/ResultsEmail.tsx`, React Email): greeting → strengths profile → "your
  certificate is attached" → trial CTA button (bands **3–5 / 6–9** only) / curious-mind ending (band
  **10–13**) → IqUp identity + contact footer. Literal-hex brand tokens (`src/lib/email/brand.ts`),
  web-safe fonts, mobile-first. Rendered to HTML + plain text. **No score/IQ/%/rank** anywhere
  (forbidden-token test extended over the rendered email + the new strings).
- **Brevo** (`src/lib/email/brevo.ts`, `server-only`): a thin typed `fetch` client (no SDK) →
  `POST /v3/smtp/email` with the `api-key` header, the message + base64 `certificate.png` attachment,
  and `tags: ['results-email', band, locale]` for later segmentation. **No CRM/lists/automations**
  (2.02 owns lead routing); **no nurture** (2.03, marketing-opt-in-gated). One transactional send.
- **i18n:** a new **`Email` namespace** (chrome only) in `mk.json`/`en.json` (exact parity; all MK
  provisional, footer/identity flagged for IqUp legal — tied to `CONSENT_VERSION`).
- **Dev check:** `npm run test:email` drives the real orchestrator per band × locale to
  `TEST_EMAIL_TO` (refuses prod/CI). **Live delivery is deferred-pending-key** — see Open carryover.

## CRM contact routing + new-lead notification (phase 2.02)

- **The 2.01 `after()` hook is now a 3-way fan-out.** `submitLead` schedules
  `after(() => runAfterLead(...))` (`src/lib/leads/after-lead.ts`) once the lead saves; `runAfterLead`
  runs the **results email** (2.01), the **Brevo contact upsert** (2.02), and the **internal new-lead
  notification** (2.02) — each in an `isolate` try/catch inside `Promise.allSettled`, so one failing
  (even a synchronous throw), slow, or unconfigured side-effect can never affect the lead save, the
  `/result` redirect, or the others. The honeypot path returns **before** `after()`, so **bots never
  route into the CRM and never notify.** `submitLead` passes only data it already has + the saved row's
  `created_at` as the timestamp (no new data collected or stored).
- **Brevo contact upsert** (`src/lib/email/{brevo-contacts,contact-mapping,upsert-lead-contact}.ts`):
  a thin typed `fetch` client → `POST /v3/contacts` with `updateEnabled: true` (**upsert by email** —
  a re-take updates, never duplicates), mirroring the 2.01 `brevo.ts` pattern (no SDK). **Stateless:**
  the returned contact id is discarded — no schema change, no new column, no id persisted (Supabase
  stays the system of record). Eight UPPERCASE attributes (`CHILD_FIRST_NAME`, `CHILD_AGE`, `BAND` =
  digit-free human label, `LOCALE`, `MARKETING_OPT_IN`, `CONSENT_VERSION`, `TOP_STRENGTHS` = the two
  celebrated strength names in English, `SOURCE` = `website-quiz`). **Consent gate (the headline
  guardrail):** every lead → the operational list (`BREVO_LEADS_LIST_ID`) always; the marketing list
  (`BREVO_MARKETING_LIST_ID`) **iff `marketing_opt_in === true`** — a non-opt-in lead is never on the
  marketing list. Missing/invalid list id → skipped (the contact still upserts). No-op + logged when
  `BREVO_API_KEY` unset.
- **Internal new-lead notification** (`src/lib/email/{lead-notification,send-lead-notification}.ts`):
  an **English-only** ops alert sent through the **existing** transactional `sendTransactionalEmail`
  (tags `['lead-notification', band, locale]`) to `LEAD_NOTIFY_TO` (comma-separated allowed), from
  `LEAD_NOTIFY_FROM` || `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`. Contains child first name, parent email, child age
  (**worded**), band (human label), locale, marketing opt-in (Yes/No), consent version, timestamp, and
  the "parent already received their strengths profile + certificate" line. **No raw answers, no
  score/IQ/%/rank/number** (forbidden-token coverage extended; the only digit-bearing values — email,
  consent version, timestamp — are masked in the test, the age is worded). No-op + logged when its env
  is unset.
- **i18n:** no namespace touched — the notification is internal and English-only (the parent's locale
  is reported as a field), so `messages.test.ts` is unchanged.

## Bilingual shell

- next-intl wired: `routing.ts` (locales `mk`/`en`, default `mk`, `localePrefix: 'as-needed'`), `request.ts` (loads `src/messages/<locale>.json`), `navigation.ts`, and `src/proxy.ts` (Next 16 middleware convention).
- Per-locale `<html lang>` and hreflang alternates (`mk` → `/`, `en` → `/en`, `x-default` → `/`); landing also sets per-locale canonical + OG.
- UI strings in `src/messages/mk.json` and `src/messages/en.json` (Meta, Landing, Test, Gate, Result namespaces; exact key parity, enforced by `src/messages/messages.test.ts`). **All copy is draft pending native-MK review.**

## Integrations wired

- **Supabase leads pipeline (phase 1.05) — live & verified.** The `leads` table
  exists in the EU project (`cpxssfodboukznzaksnb`, `eu-central-1`) with RLS enabled,
  no anon policies, and anon grants revoked. Server-side path: `insertLead(input)`
  (`src/lib/leads/insert-lead.ts`) validates with the zod `leadSchema`
  (`src/lib/validation/lead.ts`) and inserts via the service-role client
  (`src/lib/supabase/server.ts`). A browser anon client (`client.ts`) exists for
  future non-leads use. Proven end-to-end by `npm run test:insert` (anon is denied
  read + write; service-role insert/read/cleanup works; table left empty).
  **Phase 1.08 now drives this:** the email gate's `'use server'` `submitLead` action (after a
  honeypot check) builds the snake_case lead and calls `insertLead()` — verified live (real rows
  inserted in both locales with the summary only + correct band map, then deleted; anon still denied).
- **Results email (phase 2.01) — wired; live delivery deferred-pending-key.** The `submitLead`
  action fires `sendResultsEmail` via `after()` once the lead saves; it renders the strengths
  profile + an attached certificate PNG and sends one transactional email via **Brevo** (thin
  `fetch` client, no SDK). Build/render/wiring verified end-to-end (incl. the real Next runtime);
  the actual Gmail/Outlook delivery is verified once Cowork adds `BREVO_API_KEY` + `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`
  (`npm run test:email`). **Brevo is a new data processor → on the Part-2 legal-review list.**
- **CRM contact routing + new-lead notification (phase 2.02) — wired; live delivery deferred-pending-config.**
  On a saved lead the same `after()` work now upserts the parent into **Brevo Contacts** by email
  (consent-gated lists) and emails IqUp's team an internal new-lead alert via the existing transactional
  path. Build/typecheck/lint/test verified end-to-end (190 tests); the actual contact landing, list
  membership, and alert delivery are verified once Cowork sets `BREVO_LEADS_LIST_ID`,
  `BREVO_MARKETING_LIST_ID`, `LEAD_NOTIFY_TO` (+ creates the 8 UPPERCASE attributes) — one Brevo setup
  lights up 2.01 + 2.02 together. **No new data processor** (Brevo already on the Part-2 legal list from
  2.01); the **operational-list-vs-marketing-list consent boundary is flagged for IqUp legal/privacy.**
- nurture/follow-up sequences = 2.03 (run on the marketing list 2.02 populates); analytics / Pixel /
  consent banner / `/privacy` = 2.04; real trial booking = 2.05.

## Reserved folders (created, awaiting content)

`public/bibi/` (licensed Bibi art — still awaiting; `HeroArt` and the certificate's `BIBI_CERT_ART` placeholder stand in until it lands), `public/og/` (no static OG needed — the OG image is dynamic). (`src/content/results/`, `src/lib/supabase/`, `src/content/test/`, `src/lib/scoring/`, and `docs/design-handovers/` now hold real files.)

## Quality checks (Phase 1.11)

- **Lighthouse (median-of-5/3, production build, this machine; LCP/CLS/TBT lab values):**

  | Surface | Perf | A11y | BP | SEO | LCP | CLS | TBT |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Landing `/` (MK) mobile | **92** | 100 | 100 | 100 | 3.35 s | 0.015 | 75 ms |
  | Landing `/en` (EN) mobile | **92** | 100 | 100 | 100 | 3.32 s | 0 | 57 ms |
  | `/test` (MK) mobile | **91** | 100 | 100 | 100 | 3.41 s | 0 | 104 ms |
  | Landing `/` (MK) desktop | **100** | 100 | 100 | 100 | 0.71 s | 0 | 0 ms |
  | Landing `/en` (EN) desktop | **100** | 100 | 100 | 100 | 0.72 s | 0 | 1 ms |

  **Desktop hits the 95+ bar on all four categories, both locales.** **Mobile A11y/BP/SEO = 100; mobile
  Performance = 91–92 (below 95)** — up from the documented ~87 single-run baseline (now a defensible
  median-of-5). The gated metric is **LCP ≈ 3.3 s under the simulated slow-4G + 4× CPU throttle**; the
  LCP element is the hero **explainer paragraph (body text)**, which paints immediately in the
  `display:swap` metric-matched fallback (observed real-world LCP ~1.2 s, **CLS ~0**, **TBT 57–104 ms**).
  The single-digit gap to 95 is the framework-JS execution baseline (React 19 + Next 16 + next-intl +
  LazyMotion-gated Framer + Radix) under the throttle on a modest machine — expected to clear 95 on clean
  production infra (Vercel). Genuine optimisation applied (fonts already optimal for the body-text LCP;
  `html-to-image` dynamic-imported off the initial `/result` bundle; no third-party/heavy client JS); the
  brand font/animation were **not** degraded to game the score. Full write-up in the 1.11 report §2.
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA):** `@axe-core/playwright` across every route × state × locale (landing ·
  test start/question/age-fallback · gate empty+invalid · result ×3 bands · not-found; both locales) —
  **zero serious/critical** on mobile + desktop (`docs/qa/Part-1-Phase-11/axe-summary.*.json`). The 2.2
  delta (2.4.11, 2.5.7, 2.5.8, 3.2.6, 3.3.7, 3.3.8) verified; skip-link now on **every** page incl. the
  404. Two real defects found + fixed: the test progressbar lacked an accessible name
  (`aria-progressbar-name`) and the new 404's "404" failed contrast. (The "gate contrast" axe hits were
  the dev-only `?dev=1` chrome, excluded from the scan; stripped in production.)
- **Parity:** `messages.test.ts` green (added `NotFound` namespace, both locales); hreflang/canonical
  present on every indexable page; the language switch now preserves full path **+ query** (the `/test`
  `?age` drop is fixed, asserted by `tests/e2e/parity.spec.ts`).
- **Cross-device:** no horizontal overflow at 360/390/414/768/1024/1280 px (landing, `/test`, `/result`,
  both locales); certificate renders 1080×1350 and **Download (PNG) + Share (copy-link fallback) work on
  mobile** with the child's name never leaving the browser. Screenshot evidence: `docs/qa/Part-1-Phase-11/{mobile,desktop}/`.
- `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (**98/98**) — all clean. Playwright
  e2e: **45/45** green.

## Quality checks (Phase 1.10)

- `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (**98/98**) — all clean. New
  suites: `results` (per strength×tier×locale coverage, MK/EN slot parity, **no forbidden tokens** —
  digits/%/score/rank/deficit, `getResultCopy` assembly), `centers` (10 centres, fields, unique
  ids/emails), `certificate-model` (deterministic tint + **AA contrast for every tint the rule can
  produce** + name sizing/date/list), and updated `messages.test.ts` (rewritten `Result` namespace).
- **Live-verified in the dev preview** (the screenshot tool worked this phase): all **3 bands × both
  locales** render the profile; bands 3–5 & 6–9 show the trial invite + city picker, band 10–13 shows
  the curious-mind ending (no trial); the direct-access guard redirects home when storage is cleared;
  no console errors/warnings; MK Cyrillic chrome + content render correctly.
- **Certificate capture verified live:** Download produced a valid **1080×1350 PNG** (≈223 KB, fonts
  embedded, no tofu) — a sample is saved at
  `docs/design-handovers/Part-1-Phase-09-assets/sample-certificates/certificate-mk-band-3-5-Ива.png`.
  Per-child tint confirmed visually (Ива spatial+verbal = teal→green; Марко pattern+spatial = indigo→teal).
- **Lighthouse not re-run this phase** (carried baseline; final perf sweep is 1.11).

## Quality checks (Phase 1.08)

- `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (**73/73**) — all clean. New
  suites: `submit-lead` (band map, summary-only/no-IQ, consent-false rejected, honeypot no-insert,
  unknown-key stripping, action flow), i18n parity (`messages.test.ts`), and the `/result` storage +
  lead-context guards.
- **Live funnel** (both locales, `?dev=1` fast-finish): landing → test → gate → submit → `/result`
  showing name + top 3. EN (age 7 → band-b, Cyrillic) and MK (age 11 → band-c, Latin, marketing on)
  each inserted a **summary-only** row (correct band map, `consent_version` stamped) — read back,
  then **every test row deleted** (table left at 0). Anon read+write still denied (`test:insert`).
  Validation (empty + invalid email) shows field errors + moves focus to the first invalid field;
  honeypot is off-screen / `tabIndex -1` / `aria-hidden`; `/result` direct-visit redirects home.
- Mobile (375px): no overflow; submit 56px, input 52px, consent row ≥44px; CLS ~0.
- **Lighthouse** (`/test` route — hosts the gate; production): desktop **100/100/100/100**; mobile
  **Perf 88** / A11y 100 / BP 100; SEO **100** origin-matched (a localhost-port `metadataBase`
  artifact aside). Mobile Perf at the documented web-font-gated baseline — no regression (the gate is
  code-split out of the initial `/test` bundle). Gate + `/result` content states (behind
  sessionStorage/interaction) verified structurally (a11y tree, computed contrast, head metadata).
- _(Screenshots not captured — the local preview screenshot tool times out in this environment, as in
  1.07; visuals/a11y verified via accessibility-tree snapshots + computed-style inspection instead.)_
- A fresh-context review subagent found **zero blockers**; its one should-fix (orphaned
  `Test.completion` copy after the `CompletionView` removal) was fixed.

## Quality checks (Phase 1.07)

- `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (**39/39**) — all clean. New
  suites: scoring (ranking/tiers/determinism/no-total-no-IQ invariants) + content integrity (counts,
  distribution, one-strength-per-Q, MK/EN parity, reveal items).
- **Lighthouse** (`/test`, production): A11y / Best-Practices / SEO = **100** mobile + desktop, both
  locales; Performance **desktop 100** both, **mobile 88–97** (at/above the landing's ~87 web-font-
  gated baseline — same root cause, no regression; finalize in 1.11).
- Flow verified live (production build) for all three bands + both locales: start → questions (image &
  text) → reveal mechanic (timed) → completion → `sessionStorage['iqup.testResult.v1']` populated with
  a valid `TestResult` (no `iq` field). Selected-state styling, strength-chip colours, stem alt text,
  progress aria-live, mobile 2-col grid (no overflow, 56px CTA, 144px tiles) all confirmed via
  computed-style inspection + a11y snapshots. Dev preview confirmed present in dev, stripped in prod.
- _(Screenshots were not captured: the local preview screenshot tool times out in this environment —
  verified it fails even on the known-good 1.06 landing — so visual properties were verified via
  precise computed-style inspection against the 1.03 tokens instead.)_

## Quality checks (Phase 1.06)

- `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (11/11) — all clean.
- **Lighthouse:** desktop **99–100 / 100 / 100 / 100** (Perf/A11y/BP/SEO) both locales;
  mobile **100 A11y, 100 BP, 100 SEO** both; **mobile Performance ~87** — below 95, gated by the
  brand heading web-font under the simulated slow-4G + 4× CPU throttle (observed real LCP ~1.2 s,
  CLS ~0). Measurement is noise-dominated on this modest machine. Revisit on clean infra in **1.11**.
  Full detail + the optimizations applied are in `Part-1-Phase-06-Completion.md`.
- WCAG 2.2 AA verified (landmarks, single h1, labels, ≥44 px targets, keyboard radiogroup,
  reduced-motion, AA contrast); MK/EN parity exact; Start CTA → `/test?age=N` with correct locale
  prefix; no dead links. Per-locale OG image renders Cyrillic correctly (verified visually).
- A fresh-context code-review subagent found **no blockers / no should-fix**.

_(Phase 1.05 lead pipeline still holds: anon denied, service-role insert verified. Phase 1.02
baseline: both locales prerender, language toggle works.)_

## Open carryover items

- **Results email live delivery — DEFERRED PENDING `BREVO_API_KEY` (phase 2.01).** Everything is
  built, tested, and the render path is verified in the real Next runtime; the no-key path no-ops
  cleanly. When Cowork adds `BREVO_API_KEY` + `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` (+ optional `EMAIL_FROM_NAME` /
  `EMAIL_REPLY_TO`) and `TEST_EMAIL_TO` to `.env.local`, run **`npm run test:email`** and confirm in
  the inbox: the email arrives (Gmail at least, ideally Outlook), the **Cyrillic** subject + body
  render, the **certificate attachment** opens as a valid 1080×1350 PNG (right name/strengths/tint,
  no tofu), and the **trial CTA shows only for the 3–5 / 6–9 bands**.
- **Brevo is a NEW data processor → Part-2 legal-review list (phase 2.01).** The results email sends
  the child's first name + parent email + strengths summary to Brevo. Add **Brevo DPA + EU data
  residency** to the IqUp legal/privacy review (alongside the consent/privacy wording). The branded
  `@iqup.mk` sender + SPF/DKIM/DMARC + the production `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` are finalised in 2.06.
- **CRM routing + notification live-verify — DEFERRED PENDING BREVO CONFIG (phase 2.02).** Built,
  tested, no-op-clean without env. When Cowork: (1) creates the **two lists** → `BREVO_LEADS_LIST_ID` /
  `BREVO_MARKETING_LIST_ID`; (2) creates the **8 UPPERCASE attributes** (`CHILD_FIRST_NAME` text,
  `CHILD_AGE` number, `BAND` text, `LOCALE` text, `MARKETING_OPT_IN` boolean, `CONSENT_VERSION` text,
  `TOP_STRENGTHS` text, `SOURCE` text) — attributes that don't exist are silently ignored by the API;
  (3) sets `LEAD_NOTIFY_TO` (+ optional `LEAD_NOTIFY_FROM`); with `BREVO_API_KEY` + `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`
  (2.01) — submit a marketing-opt-in lead and a non-opt-in lead in both locales (`?dev=1`) and confirm:
  the contact appears with the right attributes; **opt-in → BOTH lists, non-opt-in → ops list only**; a
  re-submit **updates** (no duplicate); the notification arrives with the right fields and **no
  numbers/scores**; the lead still saved + the 2.01 results email still sent. Then delete the test
  contacts/leads. Full checklist in the 2.02 completion report §7.
- **CONSENT BOUNDARY for IqUp legal/privacy (phase 2.02).** No new processor (Brevo already on the
  list from 2.01), but the **operational "all leads" list (operational visibility, not marketing) vs the
  marketing/nurture list (opt-ins only)** distinction must be explicitly reviewed — a lead without
  marketing opt-in must never be marketed to. 2.03's nurture sequences run on the marketing list.
- **Native-MK review additions (phase 2.01):** the new **`Email` namespace** (subject, greeting,
  intro, certificate-attached line, trial heading/body/CTA, curious-mind ending, footer) — all
  provisional MK; the **footer identity line is flagged for IqUp legal** (tied to `CONSENT_VERSION`).
- **Mobile Lighthouse Performance 91–92 (<95) — finalised in 1.11 (honest write-up).** Median-of-5 on
  this machine: mobile Perf **92/92/91** (landing mk/en, test); A11y/BP/SEO **100**; desktop **100**
  across the board, both locales. Gated by **LCP ≈ 3.3 s** (the hero explainer body text, which paints
  in the swap fallback — real-world LCP ~1.2 s, **CLS ~0**, **TBT 57–104 ms**) under the simulated
  slow-4G + 4× CPU throttle; the residual gap is the framework-JS baseline, expected to clear 95 on
  clean infra (Vercel, phase 2.06). Re-measure there. Not a real-world UX regression. **Closed as a
  documented, evidenced gap** (see the 1.11 report §2 + `docs/qa/Part-1-Phase-11/lighthouse-medians.json`).
- **Licensed Bibi art / official logo / official OG art** — drop into `public/bibi/`, the `Wordmark`
  component, and the OG image when provided. Never generate/redraw the characters. **Certificate swap
  (1.10):** set `BIBI_CERT_ART` in `src/components/result/bibi.ts` to the asset path — a one-line
  drop-in into the certificate's placeholder box, no layout change.
- **`centers.ts` data is PROVISIONAL (1.10)** — the 10 centres are seeded from `brand.md` §4, which
  flags that several **phone numbers/addresses vary across sources**; IqUp must verify each before
  launch (these power the trial CTA). Some entries carry a `verify` note.
- **Native-Macedonian copy review + IqUp sign-off** — all landing copy is draft. **Phase 1.07 adds
  more provisional MK to review:** every test question + option (the 36 items, MK verbatim from the
  1.04 spec), the `Test` chrome strings, and the generated stem alt-text in `visuals/lexicon.ts` — all
  Claude-drafted/transcribed and pending native-MK review (EN is the mirror and must stay equivalent).
  **Phase 1.08 adds the `Gate` + `Result` strings**, including the **draft consent + marketing wording**
  — provisional MK, and the consent/marketing wording also needs **IqUp legal sign-off** (it is tied to
  `CONSENT_VERSION = 'v1-draft-2026-06'` in `src/lib/leads/lead-mapping.ts`; bump the version when the
  wording is finalised). The `/privacy` page + the consent-link land in Part 2 (plain-text seam now).
  **Phase 1.10 adds more provisional MK:** the rewritten `Result` chrome strings, all §6 result/
  certificate copy in `src/content/results/` (MK verbatim from the 1.04 spec, EN mirror), and the
  centre city labels — all pending native-MK review (one §6A spatial descriptor was reworded from the
  mockup's "Thinks in 3D" to avoid a digit).
- ~~**`/test` language toggle drops `?age` mid-test**~~ — **FIXED in 1.11.** `LanguageToggle` now
  preserves the full path **and** query (via `useSyncExternalStore` reading `window.location.search`, so
  static pages aren't deopted), so switching MK↔EN keeps the child's `?age`. Asserted by
  `tests/e2e/parity.spec.ts`.
- **C-Q10 cube-net** is the spec's heaviest graphic; rendered as a simple inline net + isometric cubes
  whose per-variant face marks are decorative (scoring uses `correct`). Spec §7 offers an easy
  rotation/pattern substitution if a cleaner asset is wanted.
- **Reduced-motion reveal** (manual Show / "I'm ready", no timer) is implemented and code-verified; the
  timed reveal path was verified live (reduced-motion couldn't be emulated in the headless preview).
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`** unset → `metadataBase` falls back to `http://localhost:3000`; set the
  production domain in 2.06 so canonical/OG URLs are absolute.
- **Brand palette/type are the 1.03 PROVISIONAL placeholders** (WCAG-checked, token-based); the real
  IqUp brand files re-skin by editing `globals.css` + the two `next/font` calls only.
- **GitHub remote** — see the Phase 1.02 completion report for status.
- `src/app/favicon.ico` is the default placeholder until a brand asset lands.
- **Supabase (1.05):** transfer the project to an IqUp-controlled account before
  launch; migrate legacy → publishable/secret API keys then; spam/rate-limit
  hardening on the insert path is deferred to launch (2.04/2.07); final consent
  wording pending IqUp legal; `types.ts` is verified-hand-authored — regenerate via
  `npm run db:types` once linked from an environment with DB access.
- ~~**`.mcp.json`** points at the wrong Supabase project~~ — **FIXED in 1.11.** Its Supabase
  `project_ref` was corrected to the canonical EU leads project `cpxssfodboukznzaksnb` and **committed**
  (the file is tracked — the phase prompt's "untracked" was a mismatch; live code wins). A local
  Supabase-MCP convenience, not used by the build.

## Known issues

- None blocking. (`db:push` / `db:types` need a one-time `supabase login` + `link`;
  this machine's sandbox can't reach the Postgres port, so the migration was applied
  via the dashboard SQL editor.)
- **LHCI on this Windows machine:** `npm run lhci:mobile`/`lhci:desktop` fail because every Lighthouse
  child dies on a temp-dir `EPERM` *after* the audit (chrome-launcher cleanup), which makes LHCI discard
  the run. Use **`npm run lh:median`** here (build + `npm run start`, then `npm run lh:median`) — it reads
  each report despite the cleanup error. The LHCI configs remain valid for clean infra / CI.

## Suggested next phase

**2.02 (CRM contact routing + new-lead notification) is done — next is 2.03 (marketing-opt-in-gated
follow-up sequences).** The saved lead is now routed into Brevo Contacts (consent-gated lists) and the
team is notified (both deferred-pending-config). **2.03 builds the nurture / follow-up automations that
run on the marketing list 2.02 populates** — and only that list, so the marketing-opt-in consent gate
carries through. Then 2.04 analytics/Pixel/consent + `/privacy` page, **2.05 the real trial booking**
(`// TODO(booking 2.05)` seam — and the email's trial CTA link target should point at the booking flow
then), 2.06 Vercel Pro + domain + production `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` + the branded `@iqup.mk` sender with
SPF/DKIM/DMARC (and re-measure mobile Lighthouse on clean infra). **Run the deferred 2.01 + 2.02 live
checks together once Cowork finishes the one Brevo setup** (`npm run test:email` for the results email;
the §7 contact/notification checklist for 2.02).

**Still-open pre-launch items (not Code tasks):** native-Macedonian copy review + IqUp sign-off of ALL
draft copy (landing, test, gate, result/certificate, consent/marketing wording); IqUp verification of
`centers.ts` phone/address data; licensed Bibi art + official logo + OG art + favicon; the real brand
palette/type; the **Phase 1.09 written completion report** is still missing (Lazar/Chat item — not
fabricated). Supabase account transfer + legacy→publishable key migration is Part-2 hardening.
